TrelloExcelConnector
====================

Import a Trello board into Excel, publish rows of data as cards and sync back changes from existing cards.

This project is intended to help users leverage the power of Trello from within their Excel file.

You can use it for many purposes:
* Make a backup of your board for your archive
* Clone a board with all its cards by importing and re-publishing
* Create an Excel-dashboard based on the status of the cards on your board
* Use Excel to link other types of data to card on your board
* Quickly setup a board using data exported from another source

...and anything else you can think of...

Although I'm aware putting online an Excelfile containing VBA macros might not be considered safe, I do think it's the best
way to publish it so even non-developers can use it.

Please feel free to download, review and improve the code.

Pull requests will only be accepted as plain-text VBA files, not as XLSM files.

Sincerely,
